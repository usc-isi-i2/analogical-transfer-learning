Why, are you able to secure the means of living by your plunder? Well, I have often caught and carried away an ostrich in my talons. The Eagle, persuaded by these words, accepted him as her mate. Shortly after the nuptials, the Eagle said: Fly off and bring me back the ostrich you promised me. The Kite, soaring aloft into the air, brought back the shabbiest possible mouse. Is this, said the Eagle: the faithful fulfillment of your promise to me?
