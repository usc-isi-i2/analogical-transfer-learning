By the way he met with a fine large Thistle, and, being very hungry, began to mumble it; and while he was doing so he entered into this reflection: How many greedy epicures would think themselves happy, amidst such a variety of delicate viands as I now carry! But to me this bitter, prickly Thistle is more savory and relishing than the most exquisite and sumptuous banquet. Let others choose what they may for food, but give me, above everything, a fine juicy thistle like this and I will be content.\n",

      "A LION, roaming by the seashore, saw a Dolphin lift up its head out of the waves, and asked him to contract an alliance with him; saying that of all the animals, they ought to be the best friends, since the one was the king of beasts on the earth, and the other was the sovereign ruler of all the inhabitants of the ocean. The Dolphin gladly consented to this request. Not long afterwards the Lion had a combat with a wild bull, and called on the Dolphin to help him. The Dolphin, though quite willing to give him assistance, was unable to do so, as he could not by any means reach the land. The Lion abused him as a traitor. The Dolphin replied: Nay, my friend, blame not me, but Nature, which, while giving me the sovereignty of the sea, has quite denied me the power of living upon the land.\n",

The Dog was delighted with the invitation, and as he stood by and saw the preparations for the feast, said to himself: Capital fare Indeed! this is, in truth, good luck. I shall revel in dainties, and I will take good care to lay in an ample stock tonight, for I may have nothing to eat tomorrow. As he said this to himself, he wagged his tail and gave a sly look at his friend who had invited him. But his tail wagging to and fro caught the cook's eye, who, seeing a stranger, straightway seized him by the legs, and threw him out the window to the street below. When he reached the ground, he set off yelping down the street; upon which the neighbors' dogs ran up to him and asked him how he liked his supper. In faith, said he, with a sorry smile, I hardly know, for we drank so deeply, that I can't even tell you which way I got out.\n",

      "A SKILLFUL ARCHER, coming into the woods, directed his arrows so successfully that he slew many wild beasts, and pursued several others. This put the whole savage kind into a fearful consternation, and made them fly to the most retired thickets for refuge. At last, the Tiger resumed courage, and, bidding them not to be afraid, said that he alone would engage the enemy; telling them that they might depend upon his valor and strength to revenge their wrongs.  In the midst of these threats, while he was lashing himself with his tail, and tearing up the ground for anger, an arrow pierced his ribs, and hung by its barbed point in his side. He set up an hideous and loud roar, occasioned by the anguish which he felt, and endeavored to draw out the painful dart with his teeth; when the Fox, approaching him, inquired with an air of surprise who it was that could have strength and courage enough to wound so mighty and valorous a beast! Ah! says the Tiger, I was mistaken in my reckoning: it was that invincible man yonder.\n",

A Cat, having found a convenient hole, lived with her kittens in the middle of the trunk; and a Wild Sow with her young had taken shelter in a hollow at its foot. The Cat resolved to destroy by her arts this chance-made colony. She climbed to the nest of the Eagle and said: Destruction is preparing for you, and for me too. The Wild Sow, whom you may see daily digging up the earth, wishes to uproot the oak, that she may, on its fall, seize our families as food. Then she crept down to the cave of the Sow, and said: Your children are in great danger; for as soon as you shall go out with your litter to find food, the Eagle is prepared to pounce upon one of your little pigs. When night came, she went forth with silent foot and obtained food for herself and her kittens; but, feigning to be afraid, she kept a lookout all through the day. Meanwhile, the Eagle, full of fear of the Sow, sat still on the branches, and the Sow, terrified by the Eagle, did not dare to go out from her cave. And thus they each, with their families, perished from hunger.\n",

      "A MILLER and his son were driving their Ass to a fair. On the way they met a troop of girls. Look there! cried one of them, did you ever see such fools, to be trudging along on foot when they might be riding? The old Man, hearing this, quietly bade his Son to get on Ass, and walked along merrily by his side. Presently they came to a group of old men in earnest debate. There, said one of them, it proves what I was saying. What respect is shown to old age in these days? Do you see that idle young rogue riding, while his old father has to walk? - Get down, you scapegrace! and let the old man rest his weary limbs. Upon this the Father made his son dismount, and got up himself. In this manner they had not proceeded far when they met a company of women and children. Why, you lazy old fellow! cried several tongues at once, how can you ride upon the beast, while that poor little lad there can hardly keep pace by the side of you? The good-natured Miller immediately took up his son behind him. They had now almost reached the town. Pray, honest friend, said a townsman, is that Ass your own? Yes, says the old Man. Oh! One would not have thought so by the way you load him. Why, you two fellows are better able to carry the poor beast than he you! Anything to please you, said the old Man. So, alighting with his son, they tied the Ass's legs together, and by the help of a pole endeavored to carry him on their shoulders over a bridge. The people ran out in crowds to laugh at the sight; till the Ass, not liking the noise nor his situation, kicked asunder the cords and, tumbling off the pole, fell into the river. Upon this the old Man, made the best of his way home with his Son - convinced that, by endeavoring to please everybody, he had succeeded in pleasing nobody, and lost his Ass into the bargain.\n",

      "A GREEDY HUNTER one day shot a fine Deer, and ere he could dress it, a pretty Fawn came that way, and an arrow brought it to the ground. A Boar now chanced to be passing, and the Hunter wounded it so that it lay on the ground as if dead. Not satisfied with this game, he must need pursue a Partridge that came fluttering near, and while he was doing so the wounded Boar regained enough strength to spring upon him and kill him. A Wolf came that way, and seeing the four dead bodies, said: Here is food for a month; but I will save the best, and be content today with the bow-string. But when he seized the string, it loosened the fixed arrow, which shot him through the heart.\n",

The Lion bade the Ass allot the spoil. So, dividing it into three equal parts, the Ass begged his friends to make their choice; at which the Lion, in great indignation, fell upon the Ass and tore him to pieces. He then bade the Fox to make a division; who, gathering the whole into one great heap, reserved but the smallest mite for himself.

      "A COUNTRY MOUSE invited a Town Mouse, an intimate friend, to pay him a visit, and partake of his country fare. As they were on the bare plough-lands, eating their wheat-stocks and roots pulled up from the hedge-row, the Town Mouse said to his friend: You live here the life of the ants, while in my house is the horn of plenty. I am surrounded by every luxury, and if you will come with me, as I much wish you would, you shall have an ample share of my dainties. The Country Mouse was easily persuaded, and returned to town with his friend.

The Country Mouse, being much delighted at the sight of such good cheer, expressed his satisfaction in warm terms and lamented his own hard fate. Just as they were beginning to eat, someone opened the door, and they both ran off squeaking, as fast as they could, to a hole so narrow that two could only find room in it by squeezing. They had scarcely begun their repast when someone else entered to take something out of a cupboard, on which the two Mice, more frightened than before, ran away and hid themselves.

The frog on pretense of great affection, and of keeping his companion out of harm's way, tied the Rat's foot to his own hind-leg, and thus they proceeded for some distance by land. Presently they came to some water, and the Frog, bidding the Rat have good courage, began to swim across. They had scarcely, however, arrived midway, when the Frog took a sudden plunge to the bottom, dragging the unfortunate Rat after him. But the struggling and floundering of the Rat made so great a commotion in the water that it attracted the attention of a kite, who, pouncing down and bearing off the Rat, carried away the Frog at the same time in his train.\n",

      "AN EAGLE had made her nest at the top of a lofty oak. A Cat, having found a convenient hole, lived with her kittens in the middle of the trunk; and a Wild Sow with her young had taken shelter in a hollow at its foot. The Cat resolved to destroy by her arts this chance-made colony. She climbed to the nest of the Eagle and said: Destruction is preparing for you, and for me too. The Wild Sow, whom you may see daily digging up the earth, wishes to uproot the oak, that she may, on its fall, seize our families as food. Then she crept down to the cave of the Sow, and said: Your children are in great danger; for as soon as you shall go out with your litter to find food, the Eagle is prepared to pounce upon one of your little pigs. When night came, she went forth with silent foot and obtained food for herself and her kittens; but, feigning to be afraid, she kept a lookout all through the day. Meanwhile, the Eagle, full of fear of the Sow, sat still on the branches, and the Sow, terrified by the Eagle, did not dare to go out from her cave. And thus they each, with their families, perished from hunger.\n",

      "A STAG, hardly pressed by the hounds, and blind through fear to the danger he was running into, took shelter in a farmyard, and hid himself in a shed among the oxen. An Ox gave him this kindly warning: O unhappy creature! Why should you thus, of your own accord, incur destruction, and trust yourself in the house of your enemy? The Stag replied: Do you only suffer me, friend, to stay where I am, and I will undertake to find some favorable opportunity of effecting my escape. At the approach of the evening the herdsman came to feed his cattle, but did not see the Stag. The Stag, congratulating himself on his safety, began to express his sincere thanks to the Oxen who had kindly afforded him help in the hour of need. One of them again answered him: We indeed wish you well, but the danger is not over. There is one other yet to pass through the shed, who has as it were a hundred eyes, and, until he has come and gone, your life is still in peril. At that moment the master himself entered, and having had to complain that his oxen had not been properly fed, he went up to their racks and cried out: Why is there such a scarcity of fodder? There is not half enough straw for them to lie on. Those lazy fellows have not even swept the cobwebs away. While he thus examined everything, he spied the antlers of the Stag peeping out of the straw. Summoning his laborers, he ordered that the Stag should be killed.\n",

      "A COUNTRY MOUSE invited a Town Mouse, an intimate friend, to pay him a visit, and partake of his country fare. As they were on the bare plough-lands, eating their wheat-stocks and roots pulled up from the hedge-row, the Town Mouse said to his friend: You live here the life of the ants, while in my house is the horn of plenty. I am surrounded by every luxury, and if you will come with me, as I much wish you would, you shall have an ample share of my dainties. The Country Mouse was easily persuaded, and returned to town with his friend. On his arrival, the Town Mouse placed before him bread, barley, beans, dried figs, honey, raisins, and, last of all, brought a dainty piece of cheese from a basket. The Country Mouse, being much delighted at the sight of such good cheer, expressed his satisfaction in warm terms and lamented his own hard fate. Just as they were beginning to eat, someone opened the door, and they both ran off squeaking, as fast as they could, to a hole so narrow that two could only find room in it by squeezing. They had scarcely begun their repast when someone else entered to take something out of a cupboard, on which the two Mice, more frightened than before, ran away and hid themselves. At last the Country Mouse, almost famished, thus addressed his friend: Although you have prepared for me so dainty a feast, I must leave you to enjoy it by yourself. It is surrounded by too many dangers to please me.\n",

      "A CROW, having stolen a bit of flesh, perched in a tree and held it in her beak. A Fox, seeing her, longed to possess himself of the flesh, and by a wily stratagem succeeded. How handsome is the Crow, he exclaimed, in the beauty of her shape and in the fairness of her complexion! Oh, if her voice were only equal to her beauty, she would deservedly be considered the Queen of Birds! This he said deceitfully, having greater admiration for the meat than for the crow. But the Crow, all her vanity aroused by the cunning flattery, and anxious to refute the reflection cast upon her voice, set up a loud caw, and dropped the flesh. The Fox quickly picked it up, and thus addressed the Crow: My good Crow, your voice is right enough, but your wit is wanting.\n",

Thus joined together, the Frog led his friend to the pool in which he lived, until he reached the very brink, when suddenly jumping in, he dragged the Mouse in with him. The Frog enjoyed the water amazingly, and swam croaking about, as if he had done a meritorious action. The unhappy Mouse was soon suffocated with the water, and his dead body floated about on the surface, tied to the foot of the Frog. A Hawk observed it, and, pouncing upon it, carried it aloft.

      "A COUNTRY MOUSE invited a Town Mouse, an intimate friend, to pay him a visit, and partake of his country fare. As they were on the bare plough-lands, eating their wheat-stocks and roots pulled up from the hedge-row, the Town Mouse said to his friend: You live here the life of the ants, while in my house is the horn of plenty. I am surrounded by every luxury, and if you will come with me, as I much wish you would, you shall have an ample share of my dainties. The Country Mouse was easily persuaded, and returned to town with his friend. On his arrival, the Town Mouse placed before him bread, barley, beans, dried figs, honey, raisins, and, last of all, brought a dainty piece of cheese from a basket. The Country Mouse, being much delighted at the sight of such good cheer, expressed his satisfaction in warm terms and lamented his own hard fate. Just as they were beginning to eat, someone opened the door, and they both ran off squeaking, as fast as they could, to a hole so narrow that two could only find room in it by squeezing. They had scarcely begun their repast when someone else entered to take something out of a cupboard, on which the two Mice, more frightened than before, ran away and hid themselves. At last the Country Mouse, almost famished, thus addressed his friend: Although you have prepared for me so dainty a feast, I must leave you to enjoy it by yourself. It is surrounded by too many dangers to please me.\n",

      "A MILLER and his son were driving their Ass to a fair. On the way they met a troop of girls. Look there! cried one of them, did you ever see such fools, to be trudging along on foot when they might be riding? The old Man, hearing this, quietly bade his Son to get on Ass, and walked along merrily by his side. Presently they came to a group of old men in earnest debate. There, said one of them, it proves what I was saying. What respect is shown to old age in these days? Do you see that idle young rogue riding, while his old father has to walk? - Get down, you scapegrace! and let the old man rest his weary limbs. Upon this the Father made his son dismount, and got up himself. In this manner they had not proceeded far when they met a company of women and children. Why, you lazy old fellow! cried several tongues at once, how can you ride upon the beast, while that poor little lad there can hardly keep pace by the side of you? The good-natured Miller immediately took up his son behind him. They had now almost reached the town. Pray, honest friend, said a townsman, is that Ass your own? Yes, says the old Man. Oh! One would not have thought so by the way you load him. Why, you two fellows are better able to carry the poor beast than he you! Anything to please you, said the old Man. So, alighting with his son, they tied the Ass's legs together, and by the help of a pole endeavored to carry him on their shoulders over a bridge. The people ran out in crowds to laugh at the sight; till the Ass, not liking the noise nor his situation, kicked asunder the cords and, tumbling off the pole, fell into the river. Upon this the old Man, made the best of his way home with his Son - convinced that, by endeavoring to please everybody, he had succeeded in pleasing nobody, and lost his Ass into the bargain.\n",

A Cat, having found a convenient hole, lived with her kittens in the middle of the trunk; and a Wild Sow with her young had taken shelter in a hollow at its foot. The Cat resolved to destroy by her arts this chance-made colony. She climbed to the nest of the Eagle and said: Destruction is preparing for you, and for me too. The Wild Sow, whom you may see daily digging up the earth, wishes to uproot the oak, that she may, on its fall, seize our families as food. Then she crept down to the cave of the Sow, and said: Your children are in great danger; for as soon as you shall go out with your litter to find food, the Eagle is prepared to pounce upon one of your little pigs. When night came, she went forth with silent foot and obtained food for herself and her kittens; but, feigning to be afraid, she kept a lookout all through the day. Meanwhile, the Eagle, full of fear of the Sow, sat still on the branches, and the Sow, terrified by the Eagle, did not dare to go out from her cave. And thus they each, with their families, perished from hunger.\n",

An Ox gave him this kindly warning: O unhappy creature! Why should you thus, of your own accord, incur destruction, and trust yourself in the house of your enemy? The Stag replied: Do you only suffer me, friend, to stay where I am, and I will undertake to find some favorable opportunity of effecting my escape. At the approach of the evening the herdsman came to feed his cattle, but did not see the Stag. The Stag, congratulating himself on his safety, began to express his sincere thanks to the Oxen who had kindly afforded him help in the hour of need. One of them again answered him: We indeed wish you well, but the danger is not over. There is one other yet to pass through the shed, who has as it were a hundred eyes, and, until he has come and gone, your life is still in peril. At that moment the master himself entered, and having had to complain that his oxen had not been properly fed, he went up to their racks and cried out: Why is there such a scarcity of fodder? There is not half enough straw for them to lie on. Those lazy fellows have not even swept the cobwebs away. While he thus examined everything, he spied the antlers of the Stag peeping out of the straw. Summoning his laborers, he ordered that the Stag should be killed.\n",

This put the whole savage kind into a fearful consternation, and made them fly to the most retired thickets for refuge. At last, the Tiger resumed courage, and, bidding them not to be afraid, said that he alone would engage the enemy; telling them that they might depend upon his valor and strength to revenge their wrongs.  In the midst of these threats, while he was lashing himself with his tail, and tearing up the ground for anger, an arrow pierced his ribs, and hung by its barbed point in his side. He set up an hideous and loud roar, occasioned by the anguish which he felt, and endeavored to draw out the painful dart with his teeth; when the Fox, approaching him, inquired with an air of surprise who it was that could have strength and courage enough to wound so mighty and valorous a beast! Ah! says the Tiger, I was mistaken in my reckoning: it was that invincible man yonder.\n",

The frog on pretense of great affection, and of keeping his companion out of harm's way, tied the Rat's foot to his own hind-leg, and thus they proceeded for some distance by land.

They had scarcely, however, arrived midway, when the Frog took a sudden plunge to the bottom, dragging the unfortunate Rat after him.

The old Man, hearing this, quietly bade his Son to get on Ass, and walked along merrily by his side. Presently they came to a group of old men in earnest debate. There, said one of them, it proves what I was saying. What respect is shown to old age in these days? Do you see that idle young rogue riding, while his old father has to walk? - Get down, you scapegrace! and let the old man rest his weary limbs. Upon this the Father made his son dismount, and got up himself. In this manner they had not proceeded far when they met a company of women and children.

One would not have thought so by the way you load him. Why, you two fellows are better able to carry the poor beast than he you! Anything to please you, said the old Man. So, alighting with his son, they tied the Ass's legs together, and by the help of a pole endeavored to carry him on their shoulders over a bridge. The people ran out in crowds to laugh at the sight; till the Ass, not liking the noise nor his situation, kicked asunder the cords and, tumbling off the pole, fell into the river. Upon this the old Man, made the best of his way home with his Son - convinced that, by endeavoring to please everybody, he had succeeded in pleasing nobody, and lost his Ass into the bargain.\n",

      "A STAG, hardly pressed by the hounds, and blind through fear to the danger he was running into, took shelter in a farmyard, and hid himself in a shed among the oxen. An Ox gave him this kindly warning: O unhappy creature! Why should you thus, of your own accord, incur destruction, and trust yourself in the house of your enemy? The Stag replied: Do you only suffer me, friend, to stay where I am, and I will undertake to find some favorable opportunity of effecting my escape. At the approach of the evening the herdsman came to feed his cattle, but did not see the Stag. The Stag, congratulating himself on his safety, began to express his sincere thanks to the Oxen who had kindly afforded him help in the hour of need. One of them again answered him: We indeed wish you well, but the danger is not over. There is one other yet to pass through the shed, who has as it were a hundred eyes, and, until he has come and gone, your life is still in peril. At that moment the master himself entered, and having had to complain that his oxen had not been properly fed, he went up to their racks and cried out: Why is there such a scarcity of fodder? There is not half enough straw for them to lie on. Those lazy fellows have not even swept the cobwebs away. While he thus examined everything, he spied the antlers of the Stag peeping out of the straw. Summoning his laborers, he ordered that the Stag should be killed.\n",

So far from keeping quiet, or moving away at the request of the Owl, the Grasshopper sang all the more, and called her an old blinker that only came out at night when honest people were in bed. The Owl waited in silence for a time, and the artfully addressed the Grasshopper as follows: Well, my dear, if one can not be allowed to sleep, it is something to be kept awake by such a pleasant voice. And now I think of it, I have a bottle of delicious nectar. If you will come up, you shall have a drop.

      "THE FROGS, grieved at having no established Ruler, sent ambassadors to Jupiter entreating for a King. He, perceiving their simplicity, cast down a huge log into the lake. The Frogs, terrified at the splash occasioned by its fall, hid themselves in the depth of the pool. But no sooner did they see that the huge log continued motionless, than they swam again to the top of the water, dismissed their fears, and came so to despise it as to climb up, and to squat upon it.. After some time they began to think themselves ill-treated in the appointment of so inert a Ruler, and sent a second deputation to Jupiter to pray that he would set over them another sovereign. He then gave them an Eel to govern them. When the Frogs discovered his easy good nature, they yet a third time sent to Jupiter to beg that he would once more choose for them another King. Jupiter, displeased with all their complaints, sent a Heron, who preyed upon the Frogs day by day, till there were none left to complain.\n",

      "THE HARES, oppressed with a sense of their own exceeding timidity, and weary of the perpetual alarm to which they were exposed, with one accord determined to put an end to themselves and their troubles, by jumping from a lofty precipice into a deep lake below. As they scampered off in a very numerous body to carry out their resolve, the Frogs lying on the banks of the lake heard the noise of their feet and rushed helter-skelter to the deep water for safety. On seeing the rapid disappearance of the Frogs, one of the Hares cried out to his companions: Stay, my friends, do not do as you intended; for you now see that other creatures who yet live are more timorous than ourselves.\n",

      "A STAG, hardly pressed by the hounds, and blind through fear to the danger he was running into, took shelter in a farmyard, and hid himself in a shed among the oxen. An Ox gave him this kindly warning: O unhappy creature! Why should you thus, of your own accord, incur destruction, and trust yourself in the house of your enemy? The Stag replied: Do you only suffer me, friend, to stay where I am, and I will undertake to find some favorable opportunity of effecting my escape.

The Stag, congratulating himself on his safety, began to express his sincere thanks to the Oxen who had kindly afforded him help in the hour of need.

There is one other yet to pass through the shed, who has as it were a hundred eyes, and, until he has come and gone, your life is still in peril. At that moment the master himself entered, and having had to complain that his oxen had not been properly fed, he went up to their racks and cried out: Why is there such a scarcity of fodder?

This put the whole savage kind into a fearful consternation, and made them fly to the most retired thickets for refuge. At last, the Tiger resumed courage, and, bidding them not to be afraid, said that he alone would engage the enemy; telling them that they might depend upon his valor and strength to revenge their wrongs.  In the midst of these threats, while he was lashing himself with his tail, and tearing up the ground for anger, an arrow pierced his ribs, and hung by its barbed point in his side. He set up an hideous and loud roar, occasioned by the anguish which he felt, and endeavored to draw out the painful dart with his teeth; when the Fox, approaching him, inquired with an air of surprise who it was that could have strength and courage enough to wound so mighty and valorous a beast! Ah! says the Tiger, I was mistaken in my reckoning: it was that invincible man yonder.\n",

He clapped the piece to his shoulder, and took his aim accordingly. But, just as he was going to pull the trigger, an adder, which he had trod upon under the grass, stung him so painfully in the leg that he was forced to quit his design, and threw his gun down in a passion.

A Buffoon, well known for his jokes, said that he had a kind of entertainment that had never been produced in a theater. This report, being spread about, created a great stir in the place, and the theater was crowded to see the new entertainment. The Buffoon appeared, and imitated the squeaking of a little pig so admirably with his voice, that the audience declared that he had a porker under his cloak, and demanded that it should be shaken out. When that was done, and yet nothing was found, they cheered the actor, with the loudest applause. A Countryman in the crowd proclaimed that he would do the same thing on the next day. On the morrow a still larger crowd assembled in the theater. Both of the performers appeared on the stage. The Buffoon grunted and squeaked, and obtained, as on the preceding day, the applause and cheers of the spectators. Next the Countryman commenced, and pretending that he concealed a little pig beneath his clothes (which in truth he did) contrived to lay hold of and to pull his ear, when he began to squeak. The Crowd, however, cried out that the Buffoon had given a far more exact imitation. On this the Rustic produced the pig, and showed by them the greatness of their mistake.\n",

      "A SAILOR, bound on a long voyage, took with him a Monkey to amuse him while on shipboard. As he sailed off the coast of Greece, a violent tempest arose, in which the ship was wrecked, and he, his Monkey, and all the crew were obliged to swim for their lives. A Dolphin saw the Monkey contending with the waves, and supposing him to be a man (whom he is always said to befriend), came and placed himself under him, to convey him on his back in safety to the shore. When the Dolphin arrived with his burden in sight of land not far from Athens, he asked the Monkey if he were an Athenian, who answered that he was, and that he was descended from one of the noblest families in that city. The Dolphin then inquired if he knew the Piraeus (the famous harbor of Athens). The Monkey, supposing that a man was meant, and being obliged to support his previous lie, answered that he knew him very well, and that he was an intimate friend, who would, no doubt, be very glad to see him. The Dolphin, indignant at these falsehoods, dipped the Monkey under the water and drowned him.\n",

      "A COUNTRY MOUSE invited a Town Mouse, an intimate friend, to pay him a visit, and partake of his country fare. As they were on the bare plough-lands, eating their wheat-stocks and roots pulled up from the hedge-row, the Town Mouse said to his friend: You live here the life of the ants, while in my house is the horn of plenty. I am surrounded by every luxury, and if you will come with me, as I much wish you would, you shall have an ample share of my dainties. The Country Mouse was easily persuaded, and returned to town with his friend. On his arrival, the Town Mouse placed before him bread, barley, beans, dried figs, honey, raisins, and, last of all, brought a dainty piece of cheese from a basket. The Country Mouse, being much delighted at the sight of such good cheer, expressed his satisfaction in warm terms and lamented his own hard fate. Just as they were beginning to eat, someone opened the door, and they both ran off squeaking, as fast as they could, to a hole so narrow that two could only find room in it by squeezing. They had scarcely begun their repast when someone else entered to take something out of a cupboard, on which the two Mice, more frightened than before, ran away and hid themselves. At last the Country Mouse, almost famished, thus addressed his friend: Although you have prepared for me so dainty a feast, I must leave you to enjoy it by yourself. It is surrounded by too many dangers to please me.\n",

The other, seeing that he must be attacked, fell flat on the ground, and when the Bear came up and felt him with his snout, and smelt him all over, he held his breath, and feigned the appearance of death as much as he could.

For this purpose she jumped upon a peg, and suspending herself from it, pretended to be dead. When the mice came near she pounced among them and killed a great number.

Look there! cried one of them, did you ever see such fools, to be trudging along on foot when they might be riding? The old Man, hearing this, quietly bade his Son to get on Ass, and walked along merrily by his side. Presently they came to a group of old men in earnest debate. There, said one of them, it proves what I was saying. What respect is shown to old age in these days? Do you see that idle young rogue riding, while his old father has to walk? - Get down, you scapegrace! and let the old man rest his weary limbs. Upon this the Father made his son dismount, and got up himself. In this manner they had not proceeded far when they met a company of women and children. Why, you lazy old fellow! cried several tongues at once, how can you ride upon the beast, while that poor little lad there can hardly keep pace by the side of you? The good-natured Miller immediately took up his son behind him. They had now almost reached the town. Pray, honest friend, said a townsman, is that Ass your own? Yes, says the old Man. Oh! One would not have thought so by the way you load him. Why, you two fellows are better able to carry the poor beast than he you! Anything to please you, said the old Man. So, alighting with his son, they tied the Ass's legs together, and by the help of a pole endeavored to carry him on their shoulders over a bridge. The people ran out in crowds to laugh at the sight; till the Ass, not liking the noise nor his situation, kicked asunder the cords and, tumbling off the pole, fell into the river. Upon this the old Man, made the best of his way home with his Son - convinced that, by endeavoring to please everybody, he had succeeded in pleasing nobody, and lost his Ass into the bargain.\n",

An Ox gave him this kindly warning: O unhappy creature! Why should you thus, of your own accord, incur destruction, and trust yourself in the house of your enemy? The Stag replied: Do you only suffer me, friend, to stay where I am, and I will undertake to find some favorable opportunity of effecting my escape. At the approach of the evening the herdsman came to feed his cattle, but did not see the Stag. The Stag, congratulating himself on his safety, began to express his sincere thanks to the Oxen who had kindly afforded him help in the hour of need. One of them again answered him: We indeed wish you well, but the danger is not over. There is one other yet to pass through the shed, who has as it were a hundred eyes, and, until he has come and gone, your life is still in peril. At that moment the master himself entered, and having had to complain that his oxen had not been properly fed, he went up to their racks and cried out: Why is there such a scarcity of fodder? There is not half enough straw for them to lie on. Those lazy fellows have not even swept the cobwebs away.

I will give you, she said, all the riches of the Red Sea. I will teach you to fly then, said the Eagle; and taking her up in his talons he carried her almost to the clouds, - when suddenly letting her go, and she fell on a lofty mountain and dashed her shell to pieces. The Tortoise exclaimed in the moment of death: I have deserved my present fate; for what had I to do with wings and clouds, who can with difficulty move about on the earth?\n",

      "A GENTLEMAN, having prepared a great feast, invited a friend to supper; and the Gentleman's dog, meeting the friends dog, Come, said he, my good fellow, and sup with us tonight. The Dog was delighted with the invitation, and as he stood by and saw the preparations for the feast, said to himself: Capital fare Indeed! this is, in truth, good luck. I shall revel in dainties, and I will take good care to lay in an ample stock tonight, for I may have nothing to eat tomorrow. As he said this to himself, he wagged his tail and gave a sly look at his friend who had invited him. But his tail wagging to and fro caught the cook's eye, who, seeing a stranger, straightway seized him by the legs, and threw him out the window to the street below. When he reached the ground, he set off yelping down the street; upon which the neighbors' dogs ran up to him and asked him how he liked his supper. In faith, said he, with a sorry smile, I hardly know, for we drank so deeply, that I can't even tell you which way I got out.\n",

      "A CERTAIN HOUSE was overrun with Mice. A Cat, discovering this, made her way into it, and began to catch and eat them one by one. The mice, being continually devoured, kept themselves close in their holes. The Cat, no longer able to get at them, perceived that she must tempt them forth by some device. For this purpose she jumped upon a peg, and suspending herself from it, pretended to be dead. When the mice came near she pounced among them and killed a great number. Pleased with the success of the trick, she tried another. She whitened herself with flour, and lay still on the heap of bags, as though she was one of them. The young mice crept dangerously near her, but an old one peeping stealthily out said Ah, my good madam, even though you should turn into a real flour bag, I will not come too near you.\n",

      "A STAG, hardly pressed by the hounds, and blind through fear to the danger he was running into, took shelter in a farmyard, and hid himself in a shed among the oxen. An Ox gave him this kindly warning: O unhappy creature! Why should you thus, of your own accord, incur destruction, and trust yourself in the house of your enemy? The Stag replied: Do you only suffer me, friend, to stay where I am, and I will undertake to find some favorable opportunity of effecting my escape. At the approach of the evening the herdsman came to feed his cattle, but did not see the Stag. The Stag, congratulating himself on his safety, began to express his sincere thanks to the Oxen who had kindly afforded him help in the hour of need. One of them again answered him: We indeed wish you well, but the danger is not over. There is one other yet to pass through the shed, who has as it were a hundred eyes, and, until he has come and gone, your life is still in peril. At that moment the master himself entered, and having had to complain that his oxen had not been properly fed, he went up to their racks and cried out: Why is there such a scarcity of fodder? There is not half enough straw for them to lie on. Those lazy fellows have not even swept the cobwebs away. While he thus examined everything, he spied the antlers of the Stag peeping out of the straw. Summoning his laborers, he ordered that the Stag should be killed.\n",

Meanwhile, the Eagle, full of fear of the Sow, sat still on the branches, and the Sow, terrified by the Eagle, did not dare to go out from her cave. And thus they each, with their families, perished from hunger.\n",

This put the whole savage kind into a fearful consternation, and made them fly to the most retired thickets for refuge. At last, the Tiger resumed courage, and, bidding them not to be afraid, said that he alone would engage the enemy; telling them that they might depend upon his valor and strength to revenge their wrongs.

The mice, being continually devoured, kept themselves close in their holes. The Cat, no longer able to get at them, perceived that she must tempt them forth by some device. For this purpose she jumped upon a peg, and suspending herself from it, pretended to be dead. When the mice came near she pounced among them and killed a great number.

There is one other yet to pass through the shed, who has as it were a hundred eyes, and, until he has come and gone, your life is still in peril. At that moment the master himself entered, and having had to complain that his oxen had not been properly fed, he went up to their racks and cried out: Why is there such a scarcity of fodder? There is not half enough straw for them to lie on. Those lazy fellows have not even swept the cobwebs away.

      "TWO MEN were traveling together, when a Bear suddenly met them on their path. One of them climbed up quickly into a tree, and concealed himself in the branches. The other, seeing that he must be attacked, fell flat on the ground, and when the Bear came up and felt him with his snout, and smelt him all over, he held his breath, and feigned the appearance of death as much as he could. The Bear soon left him, for it is said he will not touch a dead body. When he was quite gone, the other traveler descended from the tree, and, accosting his friend, jocularly inquired what it was the Bear had whispered in his ear? His friend replied: He gave me this advice: Never travel with a friend who deserts you at the approach of danger.\n",

      "A STAG, hardly pressed by the hounds, and blind through fear to the danger he was running into, took shelter in a farmyard, and hid himself in a shed among the oxen. An Ox gave him this kindly warning: O unhappy creature! Why should you thus, of your own accord, incur destruction, and trust yourself in the house of your enemy? The Stag replied: Do you only suffer me, friend, to stay where I am, and I will undertake to find some favorable opportunity of effecting my escape. At the approach of the evening the herdsman came to feed his cattle, but did not see the Stag. The Stag, congratulating himself on his safety, began to express his sincere thanks to the Oxen who had kindly afforded him help in the hour of need. One of them again answered him: We indeed wish you well, but the danger is not over. There is one other yet to pass through the shed, who has as it were a hundred eyes, and, until he has come and gone, your life is still in peril. At that moment the master himself entered, and having had to complain that his oxen had not been properly fed, he went up to their racks and cried out: Why is there such a scarcity of fodder? There is not half enough straw for them to lie on. Those lazy fellows have not even swept the cobwebs away. While he thus examined everything, he spied the antlers of the Stag peeping out of the straw. Summoning his laborers, he ordered that the Stag should be killed.\n",

He turned round, and said to the wolf: I know, friend wolf, that I must be your prey; but before I die, I would ask of you one favor, that you will play me a tune, to which I may dance. The Wolf complied, and while he was piping, and the Kid was dancing, the hounds, hearing the sound, came up and gave chase to the Wolf.

      "A CERTAIN HOUSE was overrun with Mice. A Cat, discovering this, made her way into it, and began to catch and eat them one by one. The mice, being continually devoured, kept themselves close in their holes. The Cat, no longer able to get at them, perceived that she must tempt them forth by some device. For this purpose she jumped upon a peg, and suspending herself from it, pretended to be dead. When the mice came near she pounced among them and killed a great number. Pleased with the success of the trick, she tried another. She whitened herself with flour, and lay still on the heap of bags, as though she was one of them. The young mice crept dangerously near her, but an old one peeping stealthily out said Ah, my good madam, even though you should turn into a real flour bag, I will not come too near you.\n"

      "AN ASS was loaded with good provisions of several sorts, which, in time of harvest, he was carrying into the field for his master and the reapers to dine upon. By the way he met with a fine large Thistle, and, being very hungry, began to mumble it; and while he was doing so he entered into this reflection: How many greedy epicures would think themselves happy, amidst such a variety of delicate viands as I now carry! But to me this bitter, prickly Thistle is more savory and relishing than the most exquisite and sumptuous banquet. Let others choose what they may for food, but give me, above everything, a fine juicy thistle like this and I will be content.\n",
      "A CERTAIN HUCKSTER who kept an Ass, hearing that the Salt was to be had cheap at the sea-side, drove his Ass thither to buy some. Having loaded the beast as much as he could bear, he was driving him home, when, as they were passing a slippery ledge of rock, the Ass fell into the stream below, and the Salt, being melted, the Ass was relieved of his burden, and having gained the bank with ease, pursued his journey onward, light in body and in spirit. The huckster soon afterwards set off for the sea-shore for some more Salt, and loaded the Ass, if possible, yet more heavily than before. On their return, as they crossed the stream into which he had formerly fallen, the Ass fell down on purpose, and by the dissolving of the Salt, was again released from his load. The master, provoked at the loss, and thinking how he might cure him of this trick, on the next journey to the coast freighted the beast with a load of sponges. When they arrived at the same stream as before, the Ass was at his old tricks again, and rolled himself into the water; but he found to his cost, as he proceeded homewards, that instead of lightening his burden, he had more than doubled its weight.\n",
      "A GENTLEMAN, having prepared a great feast, invited a friend to supper; and the Gentleman's dog, meeting the friends dog, Come, said he, my good fellow, and sup with us tonight. The Dog was delighted with the invitation, and as he stood by and saw the preparations for the feast, said to himself: Capital fare Indeed! this is, in truth, good luck. I shall revel in dainties, and I will take good care to lay in an ample stock tonight, for I may have nothing to eat tomorrow. As he said this to himself, he wagged his tail and gave a sly look at his friend who had invited him. But his tail wagging to and fro caught the cook's eye, who, seeing a stranger, straightway seized him by the legs, and threw him out the window to the street below. When he reached the ground, he set off yelping down the street; upon which the neighbors' dogs ran up to him and asked him how he liked his supper. In faith, said he, with a sorry smile, I hardly know, for we drank so deeply, that I can't even tell you which way I got out.\n",

While he was thus contemplating himself, a lion appeared at the pool. The Stag betook himself to flight, and kept himself with ease at a safe distance from the Lion, until he entered a wood and became entangled with his horns. The Lion quickly came up with him and caught him. When too late, he thus reproached himself: Woe is me! How I have deceived myself! These feet which would have saved me I despised, and I gloried in these antlers which have proved my destruction.\n",
      "A KITE, sick unto death, said to his mother: O Mother! do not mourn, but at once invoke the gods that my life may be prolonged.

      "A HOUND, who in the days of his youth and strength had never yielded to any beast of the forest, encountered in his old age a boar in the chase. He seized him boldly by the ear, but could not retain his hold because of the decay of his teeth, so that the boar escaped. His master, quickly coming up, was very much disappointed, and fiercely abused the dog. The Hound looked up and said: It was not my fault. master; my spirit was as good as ever, but I could not help mine infirmities. I rather deserve to be praised for what I have been, than to be blamed for what I am.\n",
      "A RAT in an evil day made acquaintance with a Frog, and they set off on their travels together. The frog on pretense of great affection, and of keeping his companion out of harm's way, tied the Rat's foot to his own hind-leg, and thus they proceeded for some distance by land. Presently they came to some water, and the Frog, bidding the Rat have good courage, began to swim across. They had scarcely, however, arrived midway, when the Frog took a sudden plunge to the bottom, dragging the unfortunate Rat after him. But the struggling and floundering of the Rat made so great a commotion in the water that it attracted the attention of a kite, who, pouncing down and bearing off the Rat, carried away the Frog at the same time in his train.\n",
      "THE ASS and the Fox, having entered into partnership together went out into the forest to hunt. They had not proceeded far, when they met a Lion. The Fox approached the Lion and promised to contrive for him the capture of the Ass, if he would pledge his word that his own life should be spared. On his assuring him that he would not injure him, the Fox led the Ass to a deep pit, and contrived that he should fall into it. The Lion, seeing that the Ass was secured, immediately clutched the Fox, and then attacked the Ass at his leisure.\n",
      "A DOG and a Cock, traveling together, took shelter at night in a thick wood. The Cock perched himself on a high branch, while the Dog found a bed at the foot of the tree. When morning dawned, the Cock, as usual, crowed very loudly. A Fox, hearing the sound, and wishing to make a breakfast on him, came and stood under the branches, saying how earnestly he desired to make the acquaintance of the owner of so sweet a voice. If you will admit me, said he: I should very much like to spend the day with you. The cock said: Sir, do me the favor to go round and wake up my porter, that he may open the door and let you in. On the Fox approaching the tree, the Dog sprang out and caught him, and tore him to pieces.\n",

      "A STAG, hardly pressed by the hounds, and blind through fear to the danger he was running into, took shelter in a farmyard, and hid himself in a shed among the oxen. An Ox gave him this kindly warning: O unhappy creature! Why should you thus, of your own accord, incur destruction, and trust yourself in the house of your enemy? The Stag replied: Do you only suffer me, friend, to stay where I am, and I will undertake to find some favorable opportunity of effecting my escape. At the approach of the evening the herdsman came to feed his cattle, but did not see the Stag. The Stag, congratulating himself on his safety, began to express his sincere thanks to the Oxen who had kindly afforded him help in the hour of need. One of them again answered him: We indeed wish you well, but the danger is not over. There is one other yet to pass through the shed, who has as it were a hundred eyes, and, until he has come and gone, your life is still in peril. At that moment the master himself entered, and having had to complain that his oxen had not been properly fed, he went up to their racks and cried out: Why is there such a scarcity of fodder? There is not half enough straw for them to lie on. Those lazy fellows have not even swept the cobwebs away. While he thus examined everything, he spied the antlers of the Stag peeping out of the straw. Summoning his laborers, he ordered that the Stag should be killed.\n",

A Dove, sitting on a tree overhanging the water, plucked a leaf and let it fall into the stream close to her. The Ant, climbing onto it, and floated in safety to the bank. Shortly afterwards a birdcatcher came close and stood under the tree, and laid his lime-twigs for the Dove, which sat in the branches. The Ant, perceiving his design, stung him in the foot.

      "A HARE one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the Tortoise. The latter, laughing, said: Though you be swift as the wind, I will beat you in a race. The Hare, deeming her assertion to be simply impossible, assented to the proposal; and they agreed that the Fox should choose the course, and fix the goal. On the day appointed for the race, they started together. The Tortoise never for a moment stopped, but went on with a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the course. The Hare, trusting to his native swiftness, cared little about the race, and lying down by the wayside, fell fast asleep. At last waking up, and moving as fast as he could, he saw the Tortoise had reached the goal, and was comfortably dozing after her fatigue.\n",

On his arrival, the Town Mouse placed before him bread, barley, beans, dried figs, honey, raisins, and, last of all, brought a dainty piece of cheese from a basket. The Country Mouse, being much delighted at the sight of such good cheer, expressed his satisfaction in warm terms and lamented his own hard fate. Just as they were beginning to eat, someone opened the door, and they both ran off squeaking, as fast as they could, to a hole so narrow that two could only find room in it by squeezing. They had scarcely begun their repast when someone else entered to take something out of a cupboard, on which the two Mice, more frightened than before, ran away and hid themselves. At last the Country Mouse, almost famished, thus addressed his friend: Although you have prepared for me so dainty a feast, I must leave you to enjoy it by yourself. It is surrounded by too many dangers to please me.\n",

      "A BULL, escaping from a Lion, entered a cave, which some shepherds had lately occupied. A He-Goat was left in it, who sharply attacked him with his horns. The Bull quietly addressed him: Butt away as much as you will. I have no fear of you, but of the Lion. Let that monster once go and I will soon let you know what is the respective strength of a Goat and a Bull.\n",
      "A LEOPARD, being no longer able, by reason of old age, to pursue his prey, feigned illness, and gave out that he would confer great favors upon any animal that would cure him. A cunning fox heard of the proclamation, and lost no time in visiting the Leopard, first making himself look as much like a physician as he could. On seeing him, the Leopard declared that such a distinguished looking animal could not fail to cure him. This so flattered the Fox that he came near, and at once fell victim to his vanity, being unable to flee because of the disguise, which fettered his limbs.\n",
      "A TRAVELER hired an Ass to convey him to a distant place. The day being intensely hot, and the sun shining in its strength, the Traveler stopped to rest, and sought shelter from the heat under the Shadow of the Ass. As this afforded only protection for one, and as the Traveler and the owner of the Ass both claimed it, a violent dispute arose between them as to which of them had the right to it. The owner maintained that he had let the Ass only, and not his Shadow. The Traveler asserted that he had, with the hire of the Ass, hired his Shadow also. The quarrel proceeded from words to blows, and while the men fought, the Ass galloped off.\n",

He grasped as many as he could possibly hold, but when he endeavored to pull out his hand, he was prevented from doing so by the neck of the pitcher, which was much smaller than his closed hand.

A bystander said to him: Be satisfied with half the quantity, and you will readily draw out your hand.\n",
      "A THIEF came in the night to break into a house. He brought with him several slices of meat, that he might pacify the house-dog, so that he should not alarm his master by barking. As the thief threw him the pieces of meat, the dog said: If you think to stop my mouth, to relax my vigilance, or even to gain my regard by these gifts, you will be greatly mistaken. This sudden kindness at your hands will only make me more watchful, lest under these unexpected favors to myself you have some private ends to accomplish for your own benefit, and for my master's injury. Besides, this is not the time that I am usually fed, which makes me all the more suspicious of your intentions.\n",
      "A STAG, hardly pressed by the hounds, and blind through fear to the danger he was running into, took shelter in a farmyard, and hid himself in a shed among the oxen.

The Mouse, recognizing his roar, came up and gnawed the rope with his teeth, and setting him free, exclaimed: You ridiculed the idea of my ever being able to help you, not expecting to receive from me any repayment of your favor; but now you know that it is possible for even a Mouse to confer benefits on a Lion.\n",

The Buffoon appeared, and imitated the squeaking of a little pig so admirably with his voice, that the audience declared that he had a porker under his cloak, and demanded that it should be shaken out. When that was done, and yet nothing was found, they cheered the actor, with the loudest applause. A Countryman in the crowd proclaimed that he would do the same thing on the next day. On the morrow a still larger crowd assembled in the theater. Both of the performers appeared on the stage. The Buffoon grunted and squeaked, and obtained, as on the preceding day, the applause and cheers of the spectators. Next the Countryman commenced, and pretending that he concealed a little pig beneath his clothes (which in truth he did) contrived to lay hold of and to pull his ear, when he began to squeak. The Crowd, however, cried out that the Buffoon had given a far more exact imitation. On this the Rustic produced the pig, and showed by them the greatness of their mistake.\n",
      "A BULL, escaping from a Lion, entered a cave, which some shepherds had lately occupied. A He-Goat was left in it, who sharply attacked him with his horns. The Bull quietly addressed him: Butt away as much as you will. I have no fear of you, but of the Lion. Let that monster once go and I will soon let you know what is the respective strength of a Goat and a Bull.\n",
      "A SHEPHERD once found a young Wolf, and brought it up, and after a while taught it to steal lambs from the neighboring flocks. The Wolf, having shown himself an apt pupil, said to the Shepherd: Since you have taught me to steal, you must keep a sharp look-out, or you will lose some of your own flock.\n",
      "A TORTOISE, becoming tired of her humble home, resolved to visit foreign lands, but she did not know which way to go. She repaired to two ducks to show her the road, and they told her that the best way was to travel through the air. On her imploring their help, they made her grasp a stick with her mouth, and so they bore her aloft. As they flew along, the gaping people beneath shouted at the sight of the spectacle. The vain tortoise mistook their shouts for applause. I am surely a queen, said she. But alas! as she opened her mouth to speak, she lost her hold of the stick, and, falling to the ground, was dashed into pieces.\n",
      "A STAG saw his shadow reflected in the water, and greatly admired the size of his horns, but felt angry with himself for having such weak feet. While he was thus contemplating himself, a lion appeared at the pool. The Stag betook himself to flight, and kept himself with ease at a safe distance from the Lion, until he entered a wood and became entangled with his horns. The Lion quickly came up with him and caught him. When too late, he thus reproached himself: Woe is me! How I have deceived myself! These feet which would have saved me I despised, and I gloried in these antlers which have proved my destruction.\n",
      "THE ASS and the Fox, having entered into partnership together went out into the forest to hunt. They had not proceeded far, when they met a Lion. The Fox approached the Lion and promised to contrive for him the capture of the Ass, if he would pledge his word that his own life should be spared. On his assuring him that he would not injure him, the Fox led the Ass to a deep pit, and contrived that he should fall into it. The Lion, seeing that the Ass was secured, immediately clutched the Fox, and then attacked the Ass at his leisure.\n",
      "AN EAGLE, overwhelmed with sorrow, sat upon the branches of a tree, in company with a Kite. Why, said the Kite: do I see you with such a rueful look? I seek, she replied: for a mate suitable for me, and am not able to find one. Take me, returned the Kite: I am much stronger than you are. Why, are you able to secure the means of living by your plunder? Well, I have often caught and carried away an ostrich in my talons. The Eagle, persuaded by these words, accepted him as her mate. Shortly after the nuptials, the Eagle said: Fly off and bring me back the ostrich you promised me. The Kite, soaring aloft into the air, brought back the shabbiest possible mouse. Is this, said the Eagle: the faithful fulfillment of your promise to me? The Kite replied: That I might attain your royal hand, there is nothing that I would not have promised, however much I knew that I must fail in the performance.\n",

      "AN ANT went to the bank of a river to quench its thirst, and, being carried away by the rush of the stream, was on the point of being drowned. A Dove, sitting on a tree overhanging the water, plucked a leaf and let it fall into the stream close to her. The Ant, climbing onto it, and floated in safety to the bank. Shortly afterwards a birdcatcher came close and stood under the tree, and laid his lime-twigs for the Dove, which sat in the branches. The Ant, perceiving his design, stung him in the foot. He suddenly threw down the twigs, and thereupon made the Dove take wing.\n",
      "A SEAGULL, who was more at home swimming on the sea than walking on the land, was in the habit of catching live fish for its food. One day, having bolted down too large a fish, it burst its deep gullet-bag, and lay down on the shore to die. A Kite, seeing him, and thinking him a land bird like itself, exclaimed: You richly deserve your fate; for a bird of the air has no business to seek its food from the sea.\n",
      "A HEAVY WAGON was being dragged along a country lane by a team of Oxen. The axle-trees groaned and creaked terribly, when the oxen, turning round, thus addressed the wheels: Hallo there! Why do you make so much noise? We bear all the labor, and we, not you, ought to cry out.\n",
      "A DOG, crossing a bridge over a stream with a piece of flesh in his mouth, saw his own shadow in the water, and took it for another Dog, with a piece of meat double his own in size. He therefore let go his own, and fiercely attacked the other Dog, to get his largest piece from him. He thus lost both - that which he grasped at in the water, because it was a shadow; and his own, because the stream swept it away.\n",
      "A WOLF, being sick and maimed, called to a Sheep, who was passing, and asked him to fetch some water from the stream. For, he said: if you will bring me drink, I will find means to provide myself with meat. Yes, said the Sheep: if I should bring you the draught, you would doubtless make me provide the meat also.\n",

      "THE KITES of old time had, equally with the swans, the privilege of song. But having heard the neigh of the horse, they were so enchanted with the sound, that they tried to imitate it; and, in trying to neigh, they forgot how to sing.\n",
      "A FARMER placed his nets on his newly sown plough lands, and caught a quantity of Cranes, which came to pick up his seed. With them he trapped a Stork also. The Stork, having his leg fractured by the net, and was earnestly besought the Farmer to spare his life. Pray, save me, Master, he said, and let me go free this once. My broken limb should excite your pity. Besides, I am no Crane, I am a Stork, a bird of excellent character; and see how I love and slave for my father and mother. Look too, at my feathers, they are not the least like those of a Crane. The Farmer laughed aloud, and said: \"It may be all as you say; I only know this, I have taken you with these robbers, the Cranes, and you must die in their company.\"\n",
      "A GARDENER, who lived alone, became discontented, and set out, one day, to seek a friend who would be a suitable companion. He had not gone far when he met a Bear, whom he invited to come and live with him. The Bear was a very silly one, who was also discontented with living alone, so he went home with the gardener very willingly. The gardener provided all the food, and the only service he required of the Bear was to keep the flies off his face while he slept in the shade. One day, a fly insisted upon lighting on the Gardener's face, although he was brushed off again and again. The silly Bear finally became so enraged that he threw a heavy stone upon it. He killed the fly, but alas! he also killed his friend.\n",
      "A DOG had been taught to take his master's dinner to him every day. As he smelled the good things in the basket, he was sorely tempted to taste them, but he resisted the temptation and continued day after day to carry the basket faithfully. One day, all the dogs in the neighborhood followed him with longing eyes and greedy jaws, and tried to steal the dinner from the basket. At first, the faithful dog tried to run away from them, but they pressed him so close that at last he stopped to argue with them. This is what the thieves desired, and they soon ridiculed him to the extent that he said: Very well, I will divide with you, and he seized the best piece of chicken in the basket and left the rest for the others to enjoy.\n",

      "A STAG, hardly pressed by the hounds, and blind through fear to the danger he was running into, took shelter in a farmyard, and hid himself in a shed among the oxen. An Ox gave him this kindly warning: O unhappy creature! Why should you thus, of your own accord, incur destruction, and trust yourself in the house of your enemy? The Stag replied: Do you only suffer me, friend, to stay where I am, and I will undertake to find some favorable opportunity of effecting my escape. At the approach of the evening the herdsman came to feed his cattle, but did not see the Stag. The Stag, congratulating himself on his safety, began to express his sincere thanks to the Oxen who had kindly afforded him help in the hour of need. One of them again answered him: We indeed wish you well, but the danger is not over. There is one other yet to pass through the shed, who has as it were a hundred eyes, and, until he has come and gone, your life is still in peril. At that moment the master himself entered, and having had to complain that his oxen had not been properly fed, he went up to their racks and cried out: Why is there such a scarcity of fodder? There is not half enough straw for them to lie on. Those lazy fellows have not even swept the cobwebs away. While he thus examined everything, he spied the antlers of the Stag peeping out of the straw. Summoning his laborers, he ordered that the Stag should be killed.\n",
      "A SHEPHERD, driving his Sheep to a wood, saw an oak of unusual size, full of acorns, and, spreading his cloak under the branches, he climbed up into the tree, and shook down the acorns.

You provide wool to make garments for all other men, but you destroy the clothes of him who feeds you.\n",

      "THE FROGS, grieved at having no established Ruler, sent ambassadors to Jupiter entreating for a King. He, perceiving their simplicity, cast down a huge log into the lake. The Frogs, terrified at the splash occasioned by its fall, hid themselves in the depth of the pool. But no sooner did they see that the huge log continued motionless, than they swam again to the top of the water, dismissed their fears, and came so to despise it as to climb up, and to squat upon it.. After some time they began to think themselves ill-treated in the appointment of so inert a Ruler, and sent a second deputation to Jupiter to pray that he would set over them another sovereign. He then gave them an Eel to govern them. When the Frogs discovered his easy good nature, they yet a third time sent to Jupiter to beg that he would once more choose for them another King. Jupiter, displeased with all their complaints, sent a Heron, who preyed upon the Frogs day by day, till there were none left to complain.\n",
      "A DOG complained of the cruelty of her master in cutting off her ears, and was so ashamed of her appearance that she resolved to stay in her kennel with her family. A friendly hunting dog said to her: If you had been peaceful, and not always fighting, you would have saved your ears and your good looks. If you will fight, it is a kindness to crop your ears, that they may not give your enemy the advantage.\n",
      "A LION was awakened from sleep by a Mouse running over his face. Rising up in anger, he caught him and was about to kill him, when the Mouse piteously entreated, saying: If you would only spare my life, I would be sure to repay your kindness. The Lion laughed and let him go. It happened shortly after this that the Lion was caught by some hunters, who bound him by strong ropes to the ground. The Mouse, recognizing his roar, came up and gnawed the rope with his teeth, and setting him free, exclaimed: You ridiculed the idea of my ever being able to help you, not expecting to receive from me any repayment of your favor; but now you know that it is possible for even a Mouse to confer benefits on a Lion.\n",

      "A MAN and a Lion traveled together through the forest. They soon began to boast of their respective superiority to each other in strength and prowess. As they were disputing, they passed a statue carved in stone, which represented a Lion strangled by a Man. The traveler pointed to it and said: See there! How strong we are, and how we prevail over even the king of beasts. The Lion replied: This statue was made by one of you men. If we Lions knew how to erect statues, you would see the Man placed under the paw of the Lion.\n",

The Lioness laughed at them, and said: Why! I have only one; but that one is altogether a thorough-bred Lion.\n",

      "A SAILOR, bound on a long voyage, took with him a Monkey to amuse him while on shipboard. As he sailed off the coast of Greece, a violent tempest arose, in which the ship was wrecked, and he, his Monkey, and all the crew were obliged to swim for their lives. A Dolphin saw the Monkey contending with the waves, and supposing him to be a man (whom he is always said to befriend), came and placed himself under him, to convey him on his back in safety to the shore. When the Dolphin arrived with his burden in sight of land not far from Athens, he asked the Monkey if he were an Athenian, who answered that he was, and that he was descended from one of the noblest families in that city. The Dolphin then inquired if he knew the Piraeus (the famous harbor of Athens). The Monkey, supposing that a man was meant, and being obliged to support his previous lie, answered that he knew him very well, and that he was an intimate friend, who would, no doubt, be very glad to see him. The Dolphin, indignant at these falsehoods, dipped the Monkey under the water and drowned him.\n"
